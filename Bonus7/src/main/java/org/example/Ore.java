//    Given a graph,
//            1.
//    Step 0. Arrange the vertices in a circle.
//
//            2.
//    Step 1. Look around the boundary, say in the counterclockwise direction,
//    for consecutive nonadjacent vertices, i.e., a gap. If there are no gaps,
//    quit with the spanning cycle on the boundary. Otherwise, look for a pair of crossing
//    chords from the vertices of the gap to some other pair of consecutive vertices
//    that may or may not be adjacent (possible gap 2).
//
//    If found, (i.e., gap 1 was good!), simply rearrange the circular order of the
//    vertices in the obvious way so that the two chords become edges on the boundary and
//    the gaps are switched to the interior. Each time we play this game of criss-cross
//    successfully, one or two gaps on the boundary of the circular arrangement of vertices
//    are replaced by two edges. Otherwise repeat Step 1 with the next gap.
//
//    Continue until the spanning cycle is on the boundary, or until every gap is bad.
